The [Meter.net](https://www.meter.net) project has been measuring Internet access around the world since 2014 (on former domain bandwidth-test.net since 2005, and main Czech version since year 2004). Our users carry out tens of thousands of tests every day.

=== How to ===
Place `[internet-speed-test]` shortcode whenever you want to display the speed test. You can use following parameters to modify the look:

* **layout** - dark (default), light
* **language** - auto (automatic detection based on browser, default), wordpress (based on wordpress locale), manually asign a language (cs, de, en, es, fr, hu, it, ja, pl, pt, ru, sk)
* **default-language** - manually assign a fallback language for languages based on wordpress locale if the locale language is not supported, otherwise automatic detection will be undreleased

==== Examples of use ====
* Dark theme, automatic detection `[internet-speed-test]`
* Light theme with wordpress based language `[internet-speed-test layout="light" language="wordpress"]`
* Dark theme with wordpress based language with fallback to Spanish  `[internet-speed-test language="wordpress" default-language="es"]`
